= Will this plugin need extra space =

Yes. since all images are cached with a watermark, you need twice the space for images on your server.

= Does this plugin reduce performance = 
Not much. You might experience a longer loading time on the first access to the image (normally when you upload it or on your first view of the post). But afterwards there will be no speed impact, since all logic is encoded in a htaccess-File and not in PHP.

= How can I remove a watermark =
Go to the media library, switch to list view (not gallery). Select the checkbox next to the image and then chose "Remove watermark" from the dropdown on the top of the page.
