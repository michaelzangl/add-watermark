You need an apache Server with mod_rewrite installed and a recent php version with gd enabled. ~90% of the web hosting providers out there provide this by default.

Install and activate this plugin.

Then go to Settings->Add watermark. You can upload or chose your watermark image there. For a first test, you can leave the position settings as they are.
