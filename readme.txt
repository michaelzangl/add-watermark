Adds watermarks to selected images without changing the original image.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add a watermark images on all images that were uploaded in your wordpress. The watermark is generated on-the-fly and cached for faster access.

To see the plugin in action, select "Add watermark to all images", chose a watermark image and and submit the settings page. You should then see the watermark appearing on your site. You might need to reload the page (F5 in most browsers) to bypass the browser cache.

The plugin does not change your source images. To disable all watermarks, simply disable the plugin, and everything is back to normal.


== Installation ==

Install and activate this plugin.

Then go to Settings->Add watermark. You can upload or chose your watermark image there. For a first test, you can leave the position settings as they are.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin need extra space =

Yes. since all images are cached with a watermark, you need twice the space for images on your server.

== Screenshots ==

1. The settings to adjust the position of the watermark. Those are lots of numbers, but there is a (resizeable) live preview area ;-). If you are familiar with CSS, you should have no problem with this.
